it would seem that Clinton was very off in his qoute according to the data. 
the total number of jobs produced was 50,562,124, not the 66,000,000 he stated.
Not only that the amount of jobs created by either party are rather close, being 
22,597,249 for the democrats and 27,964,875 for the republicans, not the 42,000,000 
for democrats and 24,000,000 republicans. 

Bonus Questions:
this data shows both parties being rather similar in their contributions, rather than the 
stark difference that Clinton wanted to show. As for the overall number that Clinton used, it matters little
since the ratio of contribution is so similar between the two parties. I don't know if I'd change the numbers 
much since there is little to change, I would say that it in this matter, it is more important that a president is
being productive, rather than saying it's their party that is superior to the other. If one was trying to show the superiority of a certain party over another I would find different statistics that represent a different facet of life that the president has influence over.
